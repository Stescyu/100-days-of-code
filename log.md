# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Started On First Project (Random Quote Generator). Use https://quotesondesign.com/api-v4-0/ for random quote generator. http://quotesondesign.com/wp-json/posts?filter[orderby]=rand&filter[posts_per_page]=1 is the endpoint.

**Thoughts:** Just finished learning node.js with express to access API and manipulate to create EJS files for browsers, instead of using index.html, going to use node.js to start spinning up a local server for access. All it matters is the practice using javascript. Need to get more familiar with the node package manager installations; such as request.

### Day 2: May 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued On First Project (Random Quote Generator). Problem is that the content of the quote uses escape characters format which includes all the <html> and certain char codes. npm installed underscore.string to fix issue 

**Thoughts:** I wondered if the EJS variables can find a way to link to JS files externally.

### Day 3: May 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued On First Project (Random Quote Generator). In order to submit to codepen.io for submission, I need to redo this without the custom backend technologies. Therefore have to remake a basic version where I could only use HTML/CSS/JS. Had to take a step back because I am getting this error: "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://api.forismatic.com/api/1.0/?method=getQuote&format=json&lang=en# No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.". Worked on certain aesthetics.

**Thoughts:** Need to get a better concept and understanding on AJAX, that could be the solution to the problem. CSS design could use some work.

### Day 4: May 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued On First Project (Random Quote Generator). Did a whole CSS overhaul today with minor use of flexbox, also learnt the functionality of flexbox which really helps with the columns elements without floats and makes styling much easier. Got the basic layout done. Fixed yesterday's error using a CORS extension for my browser, now using http://api.forismatic.com/api/1.0/?method=getQuote&format=json&lang=en# instead for quotes to complement the aesthetics.

**Thoughts:** Still need to get a better concept and understanding on AJAX. Design have always been my weakness, I believe I need to spend more time looking at different designs to get some aspects on different matching and design elements when I start a project. Afterall there should be a balance between looks and functionality.

### Day 5: May 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed most parts of this first project, need to link twitter button to copy quote for last step. Currently having trouble with that because the quote always return [object Object] when changed the .attr(). Will have to ask for help for this part. Time to move onto next project (Local Weather App), signed up for the API, got the API key, and next is to implement the geolocation to the API endpoint. https://openweathermap.org/ used for weather API.

**Thoughts:** Still need to get a better concept and understanding on AJAX to resolve the twitter.

**Link(s) to work:** 

### Day 6: May 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished every basic criteria on Local Weather API app, linked the endpoint with the coordinates based off of navigator.geolocation, general look for the page, a little simple. Will try to add more data information in it as well as showing the time and date of the local viewer. 

**Thoughts:** Need to work on my planning phases a little more efficient, going back and forth between documentations and research really slows down the project. Do more readings and practices especially on PROMISES.

### Day 7: May 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Just started a bit on wikipedia viewer from FCC, the main layout is similar to google, need a search box for search query and random. Need a refresher on the search query as it requires a post input that takes from the search box.

**Thoughts:** Need to work on my planning phases a little more efficient, going back and forth between documentations and research really slows down the project. Do more readings and practices especially on PROMISES.

**Link(s) to work:** 

### Day 8: May 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Linked to endpoint of Wikipedia API, the research took a little longer than expected, now working on displaying the results in a fashion that can be organized properly to show the user. More readings later on and practices

**Thoughts:** Need better understanding of documentation. Read more codes to understand code.

**Link(s) to work:** 

### Day 9: May 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed Wikipedia Search Engine. Got all parts to work, more reading for rest of the day.

**Thoughts:** Read more code and books to get better and need to be 100% at understanding each concept.

### Day 11: May 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked a bit on the design on the webpage, design is still a little slow, and I am too indecisive with design

**Link(s) to work:** 

### Day 12: May 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on 50% Design elements of the project. Still indecisive with certain elements of design. Read up on blogging information.

**Thoughts:** Maybe its a good thing to start blogging. Not only do you hold yourself accountable for your work, but also help yourself develop as a better web developer.

### Day 13: May 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished Twitch API app, learnt alot of limits. Will proceed to collaborate all the projects together in a drag and drop.

### Day 14: May 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fixed Tweet Button for Random Quote Generator, starting next part of freecodecamp puzzles.

**Thoughts:** These projects were fun and I'm glad I completed them before the 100 hour mark. However I need to start working on cleaner code and get a better thought process for each function.

**Today's Progress:** Worked on more music billboard API, got the title to show on the top 10, but nothing else yet

**Link(s) to work:** 

### Day 21: May 31, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked with my buddy Mike on a quiz app again, got the configuration, layout commencing.

**Link(s) to work:** 

### Day 26: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** More concepts of Javascript, more algorithm practices from FCC, started a food choosing program.

**Thoughts:** Need to work on the spegetti code, add more things into every project I can. Play around with design if possible. I think I should create a meal plan based off of this program. I could try to create a fitness webapp to indicate workouts and meals.

**Link(s) to work:** 

### Day 27: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** More FCC Algorithm, continued to work on meal selector program. Need to add more variations and options possibly with API calls.

**Link(s) to work:** 

### Day 48 - 57: July 7, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Through these last 9 days, learnt plentiful of React work and more javascript, on the other hand the calculator is completed.

**Thoughts:** 
Operators took a while to finish as it isn't as straightforward as it seems. But it is still completed and functions are reused.

### Day 58 - 89: August 22, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Through this month, I have worked on Pomodoro Timer, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Partial Simon Says game, mainly focusing on learning ReactJS and Redux as an important tool for job search. I also did more algorithm work on Free Code Camp webpage that isn't shown in this challenge. With this challenge almost completed, I aim to continue with other challenges coming up and will log them more appropriately to show a more proper growth.

**Thoughts:** 
Some of the projects did stump me for a while to get the proper algorithm, but for most parts all I needed to do is to take it apart piece by piece and approach it one step at a time. Need to stop overthinking for the process and fix as I go.
