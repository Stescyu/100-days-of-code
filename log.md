# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started On First Project (Random Quote Generator). Use https://quotesondesign.com/api-v4-0/ for random quote generator. http://quotesondesign.com/wp-json/posts?filter[orderby]=rand&filter[posts_per_page]=1 is the endpoint.

**Thoughts:** Just finished learning node.js with express to access API and manipulate to create EJS files for browsers, instead of using index.html, going to use node.js to start spinning up a local server for access. All it matters is the practice using javascript. Need to get more familiar with the node package manager installations; such as request.

### Day 1: May 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued On First Project (Random Quote Generator). Problem is that the content of the quote uses escape characters format which includes all the <html> and certain char codes. npm installed underscore.string to fix issue 

**Thoughts:** I wondered if the EJS variables can find a way to link to JS files externally.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
